# If your venv is the root 'bin', 'lib', 'include' folders,
# these are usually *not* ignored by default if created by `python -m venv .`
# The `*` was the main problem. If you find these folders are still grayed out
# after this change and a `git add .`, we might need specific `!` rules if 
# a global gitignore is affecting them, but that's less likely for these names.
